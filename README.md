App Dev Cloud with JBoss BPM Suite Install Demo 
===============================================
This demo is to install JBoss BPM Suite in the Cloud based on leveraging any Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).
It delivers a fully functioning JBoss BPM Suite containerized on OpenShift.


Install JBoss BPM Suite OpenShift
---------------------------------
1. (OPTIONAL) First ensure you have an OpenShift container based installation, such as one of the followling installed first:

  - [OCP Install Demo](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - [Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) using Minishift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

2. [Download and unzip this demo.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/rhcs-bpms-install-demo/archive/master.zip)

3. Download JBoss EAP & JBoss BPM Suite, add to installs directory (see installs/README).

4. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges:
```
   # The installation needs to be pointed to a running version
   # of OpenShift, so pass an IP address such as:
   #
   $ ./init.sh 192.168.99.100  # example for OCP.
```

Now log in to JBoss BPM Suite to start developing containerized BPM projects (the address will be generated by OCP):

  - Find the exposed serivce (login to JBoss BPM Suite Business Central) by selecting the Project - Applications - Routes - Hostanme
    URL.

  - OCP example: http://rhcs-bpms-install-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io/business-central ( u:erics / p:bpmsuite1! )

Notes
-----

Should your local network DNS not handle the resolution of the above address, giving you page not found errors, you can apply the
following to your local hosts file:

```
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

# add host for OCP demo resulution
192.168.99.100   rhcs-bpms-install-demo-appdev-in-cloud.192.168.99.100.nip.io 
```

-----

If for any reason the installation breaks or you want a new JBoss BRMS installation, just remove the project rhcs-bpms-install-demo
entry in the OpenShift console and re-run the installation.

-----

To clone a repository in the running container, the following actions would need to occur from a developer's machine.

1. Execute port forwarding through the OpenShift CLI. This will open a tunnel between the developer's machine and the pod through the OpenShift API pod proxy. The command window will block while the session is open:

   ```
   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ oc port-forward $(oc get pod -l=deploymentconfig=rhcs-bpms-install-demo --template='{{ range .items }} {{ .metadata.name }} {{ end }}') 8001:8001
   ```

2. Clone the repository. In another window, clone the remote repository after logging in to Business Central, creating a repository and identifying the repository URL in the Admin Perspective (this example is a BackOffice repository):

   ```
   # Read-write access to repo on port 8001.
   #
   $ git clone git://localhost:8001/BackOffice
   ```
